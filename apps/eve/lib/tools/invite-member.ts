    "Forward a member invite/referral to Matthew, the maintainer, as a private message. Use it when a member wants to invite or refer a specific person to VCMC, or shares that person's contact card. Only call it AFTER you've read the details back to the sender and they've confirmed — never forward on a guess. Requires at least a full name and phone number (email and LinkedIn are optional extras). Make ONE call per person. Tell the member you've passed it to Matthew; don't promise the person will be added or give a timeline.
